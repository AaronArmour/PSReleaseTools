# PSReleaseTools #

This PowerShell module provides a set of commands for working with the latest releases from the PowerShell [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell). The module contains commands to get summary information about the most current release as well as commands to download some or all of the release files.

## Cross-Platform
Initial testing has indicated that this module should work cross-platform. If you are running one of the alpha builds of PowerShell v6, even on Linux, you should be able to use this module to download new versions.
